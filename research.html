		<h3>Family Environment</h3>
<p>Studies support the statement that children from broken homes are at greater risk of juvenile delinquency, when compared to peers growing in stable family structures.
 Adolescents from broken homes lack parental monitoring and healthy control, due to disorganization within the home (Shroeder and Osgood & Oghia 2010). 
 Lack of parental supervision and guidance may result in self-esteem, independence, and self-regulation in behavioral issues. These characteristics are detrimental to positive development, affecting children into adulthood.
 Research supports, universal Western trend of delinquency beginning in late childhood, with most adolescent crime worsening from fifteen to nineteen,
 then declining as individuals reach their twenties (Office of Justice Programs 2014).  
	According to Matherne, without a stable family environment, juveniles will have a more difficult time growing up to be successful.
	After several studies, the following results were found: kids who have a strong relationship with their parents are less likely to become delinquent,
	kids with no parental supervision after school are more likely to become delinquent, the level of communication between families is related to delinquency,
	a cohesive family environment results in lower delinquency, and low levels of adaptability raise the chances of delinquency (Matherne and Thomas 2001).
	After assessing the relationship between family environment and delinquency it is proven that family environment is an important variable.

		<h3>Stress Factors</h3>
<p>Craigie and her co-authors believe that family stability affects a child’s well-being,
 because of the social stress theory. There are many variables that cause the structure
 of a family to change, including changes in time, changes in the economy, and changes
 in parental resources. These types of variable are causing stress on parents,
 which in turn causes stress on kids and makes them act out.
 Studies were conducted and it was proven that families with non-traditional 
 customs are related to cognitive issues in children, as well as behavioral problems.
 Another finding of the study was that children who are born to unwed parents have a higher 
 chance of having anxiety and depression, which is one of the leading causes for delinquency
 in today’s juveniles (Craigie, Brooks-Dunn, and Waldfogel 2012). 
 These issues could lead to future delinquent behavior.</p>

		<h3>Defining Family Stability</h3>
<p>The definition of family stability has been broadened into two terms:
 global stability and molecular stability. Global stability are those changes
 made within a family that the parents nor child have control of changing; 
 for example, divorce or moving to a new home. Molecular stability on the 
 other hand is one that psychologists feel can be subject to change and, if needed,
 can be altered with the help of professionals (Malatras and Israel 2012). 
 Family stability is essential for healthy childhood development. 
 There are four categories that seem to promote some kind family dysfunction.
 The first category is the when the family breaks up, or spouses separate from one another.
 The next category is when a family has some sort of interpersonal conflict, 
 meaning that the child is raised in a home where yelling is a constant. 
 The third category of family dysfunction is when a parent lacks the proper parenting skills.
 Finally, the fourth category that causes family dysfunction are when the parents pass down their
 deviant behavior to their children, furthermore leading to juvenile delinquency. </p>

		<h3>Role of Social Class</h3>
<p>Class plays a major role in the stability of a child. Unfortunately,
 disadvantage breeds disadvantage. Focusing specifically on the lower class,
 this class acquires the most instability within all social classes. 
 For more reasons than just economic troubles, the family could be failing because of divorce,
 imprisonment, or death. The reason for the struggle of the lower class is because people who 
 are employed within this status are generally only short-term or part-time help in their occupations.
 Lower class citizens also tend to work the most undesirable jobs in which they do not feel they are
 as needed as some of the others in the upper class who hold steady jobs in corporate offices, for example.
 Hollingshead points out that, “The very nature of our society may be responsible, in large part,
 for the number, the intensity, and the variety of social problems associated with the lower class,” (46).
 Those social problems include wealth, power, position, etc.
 For many people who are born into the lower-class status, in order to live,
 they turn to crime as they approach their adulthood in order to survive. 
 Lower class citizens perceive delinquency as a survival mechanism (Malatras and Israel 2012).</p>

		<h3>Theory</h3>
<p>In the criminology world, there is this idea of life-course framework that is a plaguing issue.
 This life-course framework started to take the light away from questions that stemmed from why people
 start offending in general to more in-depth ideas such as age-graded theory of informal social control,
 which underlines the importance to have a strong connection to the social institutions created such as
 school and the workplace to determine whether an individual will have criminal tendencies (Doherty 2006). 
	It is theorized that the bonds we share with others during adulthood come from certain life events from youth.
	A hypothesis that helps tests the idea of life-course interdependence is social protection.
	This happens when there is a lack of personal bonds stemming not just from family life but from education and employment institutions as well.
	Without fulfillment from these social realms, one can then become antisocial and that can lead to delinquent behaviors (Doherty 2006).
	A trend occurs through this all. If an individual grows into adulthood with the chance to develop the adequate number of social bonds through sanctions like marriage,
	then when they have children of their own they may raise them to not to have antisocial behaviors. 
	In return, those same children may grow into adults breaking barriers once again and raise their children into healthy social behaviors (Doherty 2006).
